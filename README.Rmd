[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/r-gtfs/trread.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/r-gtfs/trread)
[![cran version](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/trread)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=trread)


## Description

`trread` is a package for reading data in the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) into R as a list of dataframes. It can read directly from URL's or flat files, and does some validation of the files and variables included against the specification. 

## Goal

This is a highly simplified fork/piece of the [gtfsr](https://github.com/ropensci/gtfsr/) package. 

The goal is to break that package into parts to simplify maintenance.   

## Contributors

Among the many [contributors](https://github.com/ropensci/gtfsr/graphs/contributors), [Danton Noriega](https://github.com/dantonnoriega) wrote much of this package. 

## Installation

For now, you can install this package from GitHub using the devtools package:

```
if (!require(devtools)) {
    install.packages('devtools')
}
devtools::install_github('r-gtfs/trread')
```

## Usage

Fetch data for a bus system in Accra, Ghana from GitHub. 

```{r readme-body}
library(trread)
library(dplyr)

accra_gtfs <- import_gtfs("https://github.com/AFDLab4Dev/AccraMobility/raw/master/GTFS/GTFS_Accra.zip")
```

Count and list the number of stops per route. 

```{r}
attach(accra_gtfs)

routes_df %>% inner_join(trips_df, by="route_id") %>%
  inner_join(stop_times_df) %>% 
    inner_join(stops_df, by="stop_id") %>% 
      group_by(route_long_name) %>%
        summarise(stop_count=n_distinct(stop_id)) %>%
  arrange(desc(stop_count))
```
